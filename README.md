# Haskell Tools

 - The goal of this project is to create developer tools for the functional programming language Haskell. Currently this repository contains the **ht-refact** tool, a refactoring tool for Haskell. [Check out the refactorings!](documentation/refactorings.md)

 - We have a live online demo that you can try here: [Demo](http://haskelltools.org)

 - The package is available from hackage and stackage: [Installation instructions](documentation/installation.md)

 - User manuals
   - ht-daemon: An executable to integrate with editors. Provides refactoring and developer tools.
   - [ht-refact](documentation/ht-refact.md): A command-line refactorer
   - [haskell-tools-demo](documentation/haskell-tools-demo.md): An interactive demo for Haskell Tools.
