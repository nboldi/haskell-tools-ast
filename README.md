# Haskell Tools

The goal of this project is to create developer tools for the functional programming language Haskell. Currently this project is about refactoring Haskell programs. We have a couple of refactorings working, with support for using them in your editor, or programmatically from command line.

 - Available in Atom soon. [Check it out](https://github.com/nboldi/haskell-tools-atom).

 - We have a live online demo that you can try here: [Demo](http://haskelltools.org)

 - The package is available from hackage and stackage: [Installation instructions](documentation/installation.md)

 - User manuals
   - Use in editor: [Atom](https://github.com/nboldi/haskell-tools-atom/blob/master/documentation/user-manual.md), Sublime (Coming soon...)
   - [Refactorings](documentation/refactorings.md): The detailed description of the refactorings supported by Haskell-tools Refactor.
   - [ht-refact](documentation/ht-refact.md): A command-line refactorer
   - [haskell-tools-demo](documentation/haskell-tools-demo.md): An interactive demo for Haskell Tools.
