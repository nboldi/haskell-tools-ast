# How to contribute to the Haskell-tools project?

If you encounter a problem, [reporting bugs](report-bugs.md) always helps us.

If you want to help us by making new tools, refactorings or improving existings ones, here are some useful resources for you.
 - You can access the API documentation of the [last build](https://haskell-tools.github.io/master/api/index.html), and the [latest release](https://www.stackage.org/nightly/hoogle?q=haskell-tools).
 - We have a [general overview](development/framework-overview.md) of the framework, to let you understand the architecture.
 - The [refactoring packages](development/packages.md) describes how the functionality of the framework is distributed between several packages.
 - A collection of [programming tips](development/general-tips.md) may help you use the framework as it was intended.
 - The [project information](development/project-info.md) page tells how to run, test your code, what are the coding and versioning conventions.

## Write your own refactorings

[Guide for writing refactorings](development/refactoring-guide.md).

Check out the [Tutorials](development/tutorials.md) for the know-how of refactorings.

[Limitations](development/limitations.md)

## Write other tools working with Haskell-tools

(Comming soon...)

## Integrate the tool with your favourite editor.

By implementing a client to handle a simple protocol you can make your favourite editor work with Haskell-tools. Check out the [editor integration](development/editor-integration.md) tutorial.

## Help to improve the framework

[This section](development/framework-improvement.md) is for those of you who want to improve the framework to help your refactorings and tools. The [limitations](development/limitations.md) section could be a good start where to improve the system.
